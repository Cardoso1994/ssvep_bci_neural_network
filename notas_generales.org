* BETA Dataset
+ 4 Blocks, each consisting of 40 trials, one trial per symbol
+ 70 subjects performing cued spelling task
  + 42 males and 28 females
+ 40 targets (QWERTY keyboard)
  + 10 numbers
  + 26 letters
  + 4 non-alphanumeric targets:
    + dot, comma, backspace and space
+ Frequency :: 8 to 15.8 Hz

+ Refresh rate of monitor :: 60 Hz

** Procedure
Four blocks of online BCI experiments of a cued spelling task.
Each block contains 40 stimuli, one per trial
*** Blocks
+ 40 trials, one trial for each stimulus target (each character in the keyboard)
+ Trial started with a cue (the letter key became a red square), that indicated
  the user to focus on a given target
+ Then all targets started flickering at their respectives frequencies
+ Ended with a 0.5 s resting time
+ For S1-S15 (subjects), the flickering lasted at least 2s
+ For the rest of the subjects, the flickering lasted at least 3s
** Data Acquisition
+ Sampling rate 1K Hz
+ Band pass filter of 0.15-200 Hz
+ Another filter, "rechaza banda" to eliminate de 50Hz power line noise
** Data Preprocessing
+ Harmonics are present up to a frequency of 90 Hz, around
+ They applied a band-pass filter of 3-100 Hz
+ Epochs extracted:
  + 0.5s before stimulus onset
  + Stimulus
    + 2s  (S1 to S15)
    + 3s (S16 to S70)
+ 0.5s after stimulation
+ All epochs were down-sampled to 250 Hz

* EEG Record Description
+ 70 subjects, one =*.mat= files per subject. In total, 70 =*.mat= files
+ In each file:
  - EEG data
  - its counterpart supplementary information

** EEG Data
+ Data is stored as a *4-way tensor* with dimensions:
  =channel x time_step x block x condition=
+ Each trial:
  - 0.5s before stimulus onset
  - 0.5s window after stimulus
  - 2 or 3 seconds of stimulus
+ For S1-S15: 2s stimulus and a total trial time of 3s
+ For S16-S70: 3s stimulus and a total trial time of 4s
** Supplementary Information
** Structure of *mat files
+ Data:
  a. EEG
  b. suppl_info
     + sub :: subject [string]
     + age :: [float]
     + gender :: male/female [string]
     + chan ::  channel. Array with channel information
       0.  channel index
       1. degree (polar coordinates)
       2. radius (polar coordinates)
       3. channel name
