EEG data after preprocessing are store as a 4-way tensor, with a dimension of channel x time point x block x condition. Each trial comprises 0.5-s data before the event onset and 0.5-s data after the time window of 2 s or 3 s. For S1-S15, the time window is 2 s and the trial length is 3 s, whereas for S16-S70 the time window is 3 s and the trial length is 4 s. Additional details about the channel and condition information can be found in the following supplementary information.

Eight supplementary information is comprised of personal information, channel information, frequency and initial phase associated to each condition, SNR and sampling rate. The personal information contains age and gender of the subject. For the channel information, a location matrix (64 x 4) is provided, with the first column indicating channel index, the second column and third column indicating the degree and radius in polar coordinates, and the last column indicating channel name. The SNR information contains the mean narrow-band SNR and wide-band SNR matrix for each subject, calculated in (3) and (4), respectively. The initial phase is in radius.
